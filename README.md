## My process

  1. I started organizing HTML elements and CSS variables.
  2. Phase 2 was CSS, starting with background and card positioning.
  3. I cried.
  4. ...
  5. ...
  6. I prayed to all gods.
  7. Finished the project for now with a lot of changes that must be made regarding responsive flows.
  8. I cried again, and peed myself a little.


### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned I still have a long way to go, specially with CSS. It is a tough "language" since there are multiple ways of performing different tasks so we don't have specific answers for each case.

Positioning is a tough thing and web responsiveness is a headache for beginners. 

I also learned that I have a lot of fun doing this projects, and coding in general.

Next time I will bring my teddy bear and a glass of whisky.

### Continued development

I need to continue focusing on responsive websites. Creating development patterns that make a project and a page expandable and reusable. Just have to keep walking, creating projects every week and going one day at a time.
